#### How to write a custom template

The template repository must exist in a directory named template to store template files

The template repository needs to have a metadata file, which can be meta.js or meta.json. Include the following fields:

- prompts - used to collect user option data;

- filters - used for filter rendering given conditions.

- complete - for subsequent operations after the template download is complete

##### prompts

A standard Object object, the key is a variable, and the value is the problem object. For the specific form, please refer to [inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/#question)

**Example**
```
{
   "prompts": {
     "name": {
       "type": "string",
       "required": true,
       "message": "Project name"
     },
     "router":{
       "type": "confirm",
       "message": "Use React Router?"
     }
   }
}
```

##### filters

A standard Object object, the key is the file path, and the value is the corresponding variable name.

```
{
   "filters": {
     "router/**/*": "router"
   }
}
```

##### complete function

Used for subsequent operations after the template download is complete
